This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Start by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env` and then populate it with the necessary values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - This is the Project ID for WalletConnect. You can create a free Project ID at [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in).

After setting up the environment variables, launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the result.

You can begin editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you make changes to the file.

Happy coding!
