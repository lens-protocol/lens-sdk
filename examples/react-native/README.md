# Lens SDK + react-native

This package is an example app showcasing the `@lens-protocol/react` integration with [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/).

The example app is using a wonderful [`react-native-mmkv`](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) as a storage provider and very basic wallet implementation.

It is not published or released anywhere directly.

```bash

```

Make sure your development environment is ready to start locally `react-native` app by following the [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

pnpm start
```

Run the android/ios simulators via:
