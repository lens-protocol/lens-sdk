# `@lens-protocol/react`

The official Lens Protocol bindings for React applications. This is a low-level package, if you are building a web application you might want to look into `@lens-protocol/react-web` package.

React Native integration are already possible (see the `example/react-native` in this repo). In the future we might provide a battery-included `@lens-protocol/react-native` package for RN apps.

> **Warning**
>
> The Lens SDK is still in its initial development phase. Anything MAY change at any time.
> This is a Developer Preview aimed primarily at existing integrators so to gather [early feedback](https://github.com/lens-protocol/lens-sdk/discussions/48).

This package enables you to build applications on top of the Lens Protocol using React.
