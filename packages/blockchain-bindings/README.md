# `@lens-protocol/blockchain-bindings`

This package provides the tooling to interact with contracts on-chain. **It is not intended to be used directly.**

**Its interface will change without notice, use it at your own risk.**

## Generating contract types

We are using [ethereum-abi-types-generator](https://github.com/joshstevens19/ethereum-abi-types-generator/blob/master/examples/web3/uniswap-example/uniswap-contract-strongly-typed-example.ts) to generate types for our contracts. Right now, we only have ERC20 type definitions.

To generate the types, run:

```bash
pnpm run type-codegen:erc20
```

The types will be generated in `src/types/ERC20.ts`, do not edit this file directly.
