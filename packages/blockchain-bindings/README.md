# `@lens-protocol/blockchain-bindings`

This package provides the tooling to interact with contracts on-chain. **It is not intended to be used directly.**

**Its interface will change without notice, use it at your own risk.**

## Generating contract types

We are using [typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) to generate types for our contracts.

To generate the types, run:

```bash
pnpm run typechain
```
