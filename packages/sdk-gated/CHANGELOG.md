# 1.1.0 - 20th November 2022

## Features

- Add metadata validation before encryption
- Check for ownership of Lens profile based on signed address
- Validate the signed address owns the given profile when encrypting metadata
- `CollectCondition` now accepts the following interface
  ```typescript
  interface CollectCondition {
    publicationId: string | undefined;
    thisPublication: string | undefined;
  }
  ```
  You must supply only one of these properties. `publicationId` is used to refer to an existing publication.
  `thisPublication` will be useful for people who want to expose a publication only to its collectors. It uses data
  from Lens API to calculate the next publicationId, and save it on LIT Protocol.
- Gated client looks in localStorage for a valid `AuthSig` to avoid asking for signature if not necessary.
- Remove `chainId` field from EoaCondition
